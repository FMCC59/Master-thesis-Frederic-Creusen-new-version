Nowadays, a smart use of the appendix is becoming more and more important. People do not have enough time to read long documents anymore (that's the truth...). So, the best journal articles (Nature \& Science) adopted a format where there is a short ``main body'' and then there is a long ``Supporting Information'' (which is the Appendix of a thesis).

My general advice is for you to do the same. Write concisely the essential information that you put in the main body. Focus on the main message and the key storyline. Then, leave to the appendices all supporting results, modeling details, secondary arguments, etc.
