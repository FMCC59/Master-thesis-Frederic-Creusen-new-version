  Abstract                 = {Abstract A new data-driven computational framework is developed to assist in the design and modeling of new material systems and structures. The proposed framework integrates three general steps: (1) design of experiments, where the input variables describing material geometry (microstructure), phase properties and external conditions are sampled; (2) efficient computational analyses of each design sample, leading to the creation of a material response database; and (3) machine learning applied to this database to obtain a new design or response model. In addition, the authors address the longstanding challenge of developing a data-driven approach applicable to problems that involve unacceptable computational expense when solved by standard analysis methods – e.g. finite element analysis of representative volume elements involving plasticity and damage. In these cases the framework includes the recently developed “self-consistent clustering analysis” method in order to build large databases suitable for machine learning. The authors believe that this will open new avenues to finding innovative materials with new capabilities in an era of high-throughput computing (“big-data”). },

  Abstract                 = {A data-driven computational framework combining Bayesian regression for imperfection-sensitive quantities of interest, uncertainty quantification and multi-objective optimization is developed for the design of complex structures. The framework is used to design ultra-thin carbon fiber deployable shells subjected to two bending conditions. Significant increases in the ultimate buckling loads are shown to be possible, with potential gains on the order of 100% as compared to a previously proposed design. The key to this result is the existence of a large load reserve capability after the initial bifurcation point and well into the post-buckling range that can be effectively explored by the data-driven approach. The computational strategy here presented is general and can be applied to different problems in structural and materials design, with the potential of finding relevant designs within high-dimensional spaces.},
