%\dropcap{T}{he} introduction chapter should be short (1 to 3 pages). In the first paragraph, briefly refer the intent of this work and the main solution proposed. Then use the following paragraphs to provide the Big Picture\footnote{In other words: Why should we care? Including one figure motivating the thesis can be useful.}, and discuss the main challenge(s) without presenting alternative solutions (that's for Chapter \ref{chp:lit_rev}). The last paragraph typically contains the thesis' structure.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) is trying to keep the equipment of it's forces at full capability through intensive maintenance at home bases and in remote areas. The systems in use (vehicles, weapon systems, auxiliary systems etc.) can have different sets of complexity and date from different era's. At home bases, maintenance can rely on off-the-shelf parts when time-to-failure can be reasonably estimated, but predicting the lifetime of multiple components is challenging and creates a logistical issue. Additionally, these parts can be expensive due to their infrequent production or because the systems became outdated and production has stopped. The above described situation is even more crucial and complicated in foreign operation bases or on remote operating platforms such as ships. A rare part is difficult to come by in a remote area and can be extremely time consuming and expensive to obtain.

Additive manufacturing (3D printing or rapid manufacturing) can help reducing the above mentioned issues. Among the myriad of 3D printing processes currently available \todo{references}, polymer fused filament fabrication (FFF) dominates the market due to it's simplicity and low cost \cite{WohlersAssociates2017WohlersIndustry} \todo{check if this reference is adequate}. Polymer based parts are a huge part of our current society, in consumer products as well as in engineering systems. The relevance of 3D printing polymer parts for Defence applications has been studied thoroughly \cite{Bastiaans2015DeDefensie,NATOPerspectivesOperations,Joyce20143DDefense}, where the benefits for the MoD have been clarified: smaller logistic chains, possibility to produce cheaper alternatives with respect to conventional manufactures, fast innovation and iterations of products, production of complex geometries, in-house development of (classified) systems, the production of parts for obsolete systems due to unavailable producers, and finally the production of parts in remote areas.

These arguments are the inducements for the MoD to start exploring 3D printing. At the beginning of the 2010's different departments inside the MoD started to acquire simple systems to produce and experiment with early prototypes and non-critical parts. This lead to the acquisition of more complex FFF and additional machines to produce functional parts. Despite these being of low quality and for non-critical parts, 3D printing seemed to fill in a need for small complex parts that normally took too long to order or to make. Also, due to the short lead time a large wave of iterations and innovations came from these small 3D printing groups. Currently, 3D printers are being implemented in different departments at home bases and abroad, first pilots at operation bases and on ships have been successful and are being implemented as permanent tools for fast production of non-critical parts. At this point, considering the success of the FFF implemented systems, the MoD wants to expand its knowledge and production capacity towards more critical parts. The logical choices being investing in metal additive manufacturing systems or optimizing the results of the FFF system. Despite that the FFF process has been optimized to a large degree, the results are still not comparable to conventional produced polymers. Often the mechanical properties of FFF printed polymer parts are as low as 50\% of the properties obtained from injection moulded parts, for example \todo{reference!}. This significantly obstructs the MoD from implementing FFF products in functional appliances. The first step towards the wider use of FFF parts in the logistical chain would be to identify and predict its mechanical behaviour and quality.

To be able to produce and predict the properties of FFF printed polymers more knowledge needs to be acquired before the MoD can implement FFF for critical polymer parts. TNO (Nederlandse Organisatie voor Toegepast Natuurwetenschappelijk Onderzoek) is one of the advisers and research organizations that advises the MoD on related subjects. One of the key factors in increasing the mechanical properties of FFF printed parts is understanding the physical phenomena of the process and the materials science of the produced parts, which is the subject of this thesis. The goal of this thesis is to identify the mechanical behaviour, and to predict it through the modification of known models and simulation tools.

This dissertation follows the subsequent structure. In the first part, an extensive literature study of the FFF principles and the available research will be discussed. Based on the literature the knowledge gap is identified and the research questions are formulated. The second part of the thesis consists of four chapters, each of which include the methodologies, results, discussions and conclusions. Chapter 4 discusses the investigation on the mesostructure and the definition of a new Representative Volume Element. Chapter 5 presents the empirical testing of FFF products and the complications involved with it. Chapter 6 discusses the elastic properties of the Representative Volume Element, and applies a Finite Element Method homogenization approach to determine the elasticity in the 3 principle directions. Chapter 7 discusses the most important knowledge gap, the prediction of non-linear behaviour of FFF product through the Finite Element Method. In this chapter the effort and information of the previous chapters is combined to substantiate the effectiveness of the model and  the results. Finally, a global conclusion and recommendation is presented in the last chapter. 



%This document will first discuss the known research involving the FFF process en products, and additionally the knowledge on models and simulations that can be implemented for FFF. This includes the use of theories involving composites, homogenization and the use of FEM software like Abaqus. Afterwards, experiments on the characterization of mechanical properties and the identification of the phenomena are presented. The following chapters are concerned with finite element analysis (FEA) of the mechanical properties and the comparison with other analytical methods. The results will finally be discussed and compared with the experimental data. Based on this comparison, a discussion and conclusion will follow, where the difference and recommendations are presented.
